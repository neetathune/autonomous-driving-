Problem Statement:

The primary objectives of this capstone project are as follows:
 a) Lane Detection: To enable a self-driving vehicle to navigate effectively, we need to implement a lane detection system. This system should take an image from a car dashboard or a video feed as input and produce an output image with the lanes marked. 
b) Steering Angle Calculation: Once the lanes are detected and marked, the next step is to use these lanes as guidance to determine the steering angle for autonomous driving. The steering angle should be calculated based on the relative position of the center of the captured image and the center of the detected lanes. This will enable the self-driving vehicle to stay within the lanes and navigate safely.

Introduction: 
Self-driving vehicles represent a technological revolution in the automotive industry. The ability of a self-driving car to navigate safely and efficiently is heavily dependent on the accurate detection of lanes on the road. This project aims to develop a Lane Detection system for self-driving vehicles that can detect and mark the lanes in real-time, and subsequently use this information to determine the steering angle for autonomous driving.
Humans can easily identify and understand road markings like yellow and white lines, but for a computer, these are just pixels with different color values. Teaching a computer to recognize and interpret these features requires sophisticated image processing and computer vision techniques.


Prerequisite:
Knowledge of python, ML and deep learning. Deep learning involves utilizing multiple-layered neural networks, which use mathematical properties to minimize losses from predictions vs. actuals to converge toward a final model, effectively learning as they train on data

Dataset: 
The dataset provided in the project description (e.g., https://xingangpan.github.io/projects/CULane.html) .
CULane is a large scale challenging dataset for academic research on traffic lane detection. It is collected by cameras mounted on six different vehicles driven by different drivers in Beijing.
Data examples are shown below in the figure 1.
